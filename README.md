Helping Ext JS developers get up to speed with React

## Q&A
**Q:** `sencha app watch` doesn't work here. How do I run this thing?

**A:** That's a wonderful question. Thank you for checking out this repo. Your business is very valuable to us. You're amazing. How's the cave?

1. Run `npm install`. Please don't `sudo`. That's a nðŸ‘€bie thing to do. Note: If the `Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please re-run as root via sudo.` message shows up, open Xcode and accept the new user agreement. Then re-run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`
3. Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

Bonus steps. These are not required, but may be fun or helpful. 

- Use Chrome
- Install [React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
- Enable [experimental support for ES6](chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony) in Chrome: `chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony`
